# CChess - A CLI Chess

## About

CChess is a simple CLI chess program made with ncurses to play chess at [lichess.org](https://lichess.org/). The program is written for linux, although with cygwin it is possible to build it for Windows or simply just use WSL. The program is written completely in C. It is recommended to use it in font 35 (1920x1080; maximized terminal). Nerd fonts are recommended, although it is **NOT** a requirement. You can't register a lichess account thru cchess.

## TODO List

- Add proper cleanups
- More robust JSON/API fail handling
- Proper file locations
