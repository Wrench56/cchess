# CChess - A CLI Chess

## About

CChess is a simple CLI chess program made with ncurses to play chess at [lichess.org](https://lichess.org/). The program is completely OS unspecific, although you might have to build it on your machine. The program is written completely in C. It is recommended to use it in font size 40. Nerd fonts are recommended, although it is **NOT** a requirement. You can't register a lichess account thru cchess.

## Limitations

A lot to be honest...
